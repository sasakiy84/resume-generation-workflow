  abstract = {This study explores the distributional characteristics of nouns of Japanese prime ministers' Diet addresses for interpreting two political phenomena. Previous content analysis studies focused only on a few content words for interpreting social phenomena and stylistic studies used stylistic characteristics independent on content of the texts with the aim of detecting their authors, genres, and chronological variations. This study focused, instead of these features, on distributional characteristics of nouns for better understanding two political phenomena: (a)  the difference between the two types of Diet addresses delivered by Japanese prime ministers, and,  (b)  the perceived changes made to these addresses by two powerful prime ministers. This study expands the aims and scopes of text analysis by showing the effectiveness of exploring these microscopic textual characteristics for interpreting political phenomena.},

  abstract = {In this study we extracted speaker-specific functional expressions from political speeches using random forests to investigate speakers' political styles. Along with methodological development, stylistics has expanded its scope into new areas of application such as authorship profiling and sentiment analysis in addition to conventional areas such as authorship attribution and genre-based text classification. Among these, computational sociolinguistics, which aims at providing a systematic and solid basis for sociolinguistic analysis using machine learning and linguistically-motivated features, is a potentially important area. In this study we showed the effectiveness of the random forests classifier for such tasks by applying it to Japanese prime ministers' Diet speeches. The results demonstrated that our method successfully extracted the speaker-specific expressions of two Japanese prime ministers, and enabled us to investigate their political styles in a systematic manner. The method can be applied to sociolinguistic analysis of various other types of texts, and in this way, this study will contribute to developing the area of computational sociolinguistics.},
